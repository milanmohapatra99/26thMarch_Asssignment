    "Multicollinearity refers to the situation in multiple linear regression where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This high correlation makes it difficult for the model to distinguish the individual effects of these variables on the dependent variable. In other words, multicollinearity introduces instability and uncertainty in the coefficient estimates, and it can lead to challenges in interpreting the results accurately.\n",

    "Detection of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to detect multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Correlation Matrix: Calculate the correlation matrix between all pairs of predictor variables. Correlation coefficients close to +1 or -1 indicate strong linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): VIF measures how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. A high VIF (typically greater than 5 or 10) suggests significant multicollinearity for that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Tolerance: Tolerance is the reciprocal of VIF and provides a measure of how much of the variance in one predictor variable can be explained by the other predictor variables. Low tolerance values indicate high multicollinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "1- Remove Redundant Variables: If you have strong theoretical reasons to believe that certain variables are redundant, you can remove one of the correlated variables.\n",

    "2- Feature Selection: Use techniques like stepwise regression or regularization (e.g., Ridge or Lasso regression) to automatically select relevant variables and penalize the impact of multicollinearity.\n",

    "3- Combine Variables: If possible, combine correlated variables into composite variables. For example, if you have height and weight, you could create a Body Mass Index (BMI) variable.\n",

    "4- Collect More Data: Increasing the sample size can sometimes mitigate multicollinearity, as more data points can help in stabilizing coefficient estimates.\n",

    "5- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA can transform the original correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated principal components, reducing multicollinearity.\n",
